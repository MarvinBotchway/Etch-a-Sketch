# Etch-a-Sketch

### My Rendition Of The Etch-a-Sketch Project From "The Odin Project".

#### Description

This is a fun little project which puts together knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript expecially JavaScript DOM manipulation to create an app which is a cross between a sketchpad and an [Etch-A-Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch). The project uses vanilla javascript with no frameworks.
